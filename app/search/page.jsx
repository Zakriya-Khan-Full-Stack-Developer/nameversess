              NameVerse indexes every one of its 42,000+ names so you can search the way you actually
              think — by a name you heard, a meaning you love, a language you come from, or a faith
              you follow. Because every record carries its religion, gender, origin, category and
              popularity score, a single search can answer &ldquo;Arabic girl names that mean light&rdquo; as
              easily as it can find a specific spelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use the filters above to combine traditions with gender, then sort by popularity to see
              which choices are beloved by parents right now. Every result opens into a full profile
              with pronunciation, lucky numbers, numerology, name variations and cultural context.
